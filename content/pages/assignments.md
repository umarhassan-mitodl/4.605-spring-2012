1\. Context
{{< tdclose >}}
{{< tdopen >}}
By context, we mean siting in the landscape or city. In this paper you should analyze how the building accommodates its particular context, which may range from how it is sited and oriented to the surrounding city. How do these design choices affect the internal planning of the building?

{{< tdopen >}}
In this paper you should analyze the plan and section of the building. You can provide your own sketches. If you find published sketches or drawings that it OK, but you must acknowledge that. How does the plan 'work?' What are the principal elements. The same holds for the section of the building.

Notes:

*   There might be some overlap between themes. If you discuss 'use,' you might also have to discuss ' plan' and so forth, but the idea is consistency.
*   This paper does not require any specific literature or 'reading.' Of course any reading that you do is welcome. However, anything that is cited, borrowed or quoted from any source (including from the web) must be fully cited!
*   Each paper will also be checked for plagiarism by the TAs and by a plagiarism-searching software program.
